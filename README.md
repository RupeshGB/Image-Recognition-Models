This notebook is part of CS 4476/6476 Project 2, focusing on local feature matching in computer vision. It guides the user through loading and resizing images, detecting interest points using techniques like the Harris Corner Detector, describing those points with local features, and matching features across images. Several core components—such as interest point detection, feature description, and feature matching—are left for the user to implement, allowing hands-on practice with fundamental image processing techniques. The notebook also includes tools for visualizing and evaluating the accuracy of feature matches based on ground truth data.
